# DaPlayer I18n

This repository contains the different translation files (in JSON format) and
functions to manage internationalization inside DaPlayer. You can use it but
keys may not be organized as you would expect them to be.

At the moment, the supported languages are:

* English
* French

## Usage

This repository isn't published on NPM; you should rather download the tar or
reference it from your `package.json` file:

~~~json
{
  "daplayer-i18n": "https://github.com/daplayer/i18n"
}
~~~

Then you can add the following to your code:

~~~javascript
const I18n = require('daplayer-i18n');

// Make sure to load the locale that you want
I18n.load('fr');
~~~

Finally, to get a specific translation, you just need to call the `t`
function like this:

~~~javascript
I18n.t('local.sidebar.local_files');
// => "Fichiers locaux"

I18n.t('local.feedback.progress', {
  current: 10,
  total:   200
});
// => "10 fichiers trait√©s sur 200."
~~
